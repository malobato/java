# Gyroscope websocket demo
In this project I want to send gyroscope data read in my mobile phone to a web page. You can use it to control a game for example.

## How to use it

Run it with
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Go to ```http://localhost:8080``` in your desktop Chrome navigator.

Go to the control page in your mobile phone Chrome navigator ```http://{server-ip}:8080/control.html```

Now, you can see the data of your mobile phone gyroscope in your desktop.

Enjoy it!
